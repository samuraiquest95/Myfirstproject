A software repository, or “repo” for short, is a storage location for software packages. Often a table of contents is also stored, 
along with metadata. A software repository is typically managed by source control or repository managers. Package Managers allow for 
installing and updating the repositories (sometimes called “packages”) versus having to do this manually.
